        <h2>üìú The prophecy</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a curious individual named Milan, who was
          always interested in how things worked. As a child, he loved taking
          things apart and putting them back together, just to see what made
          them tick. As he grew older, his interest in technology and the
          internet piqued. He loved the feeling of creating something from
          scratch, and the rush of excitement he got from seeing his creations
          come to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, after finishing school, Milan decided to pursue a career in web
          development. He worked hard, taking on numerous courses and projects
          to hone his skills and build his portfolio. He loved the challenge of
          solving complex problems and bringing new ideas to life on the web.
          Now, Milan is a skilled web developer with a passion for innovation
          and creativity. He enjoys using his expertise to help businesses and
          individuals bring their ideas to life on the internet. Whether it's
          building a simple website or a complex web application, he is always
          up for the challenge. He is now happy retired man with a loving wife
          and 3 kids running around his house playing hide and seek.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back on his journey, Milan is grateful for all the
          opportunities he had been given and excited for what the future holds.
          He is proud of his achievements which made the world a better place
          and is hoping that his achievements will spark the fire of motivation
          in young people to make the positive impact as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hi, this is Milan, main character in the story above! Right now I am
          at the second paragraph of the prophecy which was given to me by the
          heavens. I am doing my best to keep to it as much as possible, because
          I don't want to anger the gods. Thanks for reading my brief
          introduction, and keep scrolling to meet the Moon!

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          When I learned the basics of frontend development, I started honing my
          skills through various projects. You can check some of them here:
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Forkify</h3>
          <span>It's a web app where you can search for recipes. It includes the search bar, pagination for recipes, portion control, links to original recipes, bookmarks and more stuff. It also has a feature of adding your own recipes to the database! You can check it out
          <a href="https://forkify-milan44.netlify.app/" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù class="links">here</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Mapty</h3>
          <span>It's a web app for logging your running and cycling workouts directly on the map. It automatically detects your location and positions the map accordingly (you need to allow location access though). You can log the distance you traveled, duration of your workout, and also cadence/elevation gain depending on the type of workout. You can check it out
          <a href="https://mapty-milan44.netlify.app/" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù class="links">here</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Bankist</h3>
          <span>It's a demo web app where you can send money to other people and take loans. There you have the history of your transactions, which include date, type of transaction and also the amount (sorting is also supported!). It also includes your current balance and a 5 minute timer which logs you out automatically when inactive. You can check it out</span>
          <a href="https://bankist-app-milan44.netlify.app/" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù class="links">here</a>
          <span>(try logging with these credentials: username: js, password: 1111).</span>

        <h2>üíª Work History</h2>

        <h3>Connect the Dots</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently working in American-Serbian startup Connect the Dots as
          a Frontend developer, where I play a critical role in building and
          maintaining the company's online presence. My responsibilities include
          developing and implementing user-friendly interfaces, writing
          efficient and clean code, and collaborating with designers and other
          developers to create a seamless web application. I work closely with
          my team to ensure that the website is both visually appealing and
          functional, with an emphasis on delivering a smooth user experience. I
          am also responsible for testing and debugging code, as well as staying
          up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the field.
